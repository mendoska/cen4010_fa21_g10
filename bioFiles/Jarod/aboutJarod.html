        <h1>Jarod Crush</h1>

        <p>Hi I am Jarod and I am part of my team's development section. I have a degree in English and have just started my last year for my degree in Computer Science.
            I have a passion for reading and writing in the English language and pretty much any coding language.
             I view coding as a hobby turned passion and learn everything I can about it outside of school. Specifically I have been interested in
            Web Development, Cybersecurity, and System Administration so far. I find all these topics extremely interesting and can't wait to make a
            career out of one of them.</p>

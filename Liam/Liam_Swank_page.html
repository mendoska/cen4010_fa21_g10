            <p>As a member of the Development team, it is my duty to contirbute to the development of the software and the documentation for the software, this is arguably the most important role since it involves actually making the product. On top of making the product, we should be in consistently communicating with both the Scrum Master and the Product Owner to insure that the product is being made on time and meets the requirements.</p>
